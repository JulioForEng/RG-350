Welcome to the central RG-350 GitHub for the Retro Game Handhelds Discord. This GitHub has been set up as a central repository for Wiki pages concerning the device, as well as a central location to report issues. Keep in mind that when reporting issues, the devs check this repository periodically and voluntarily: this is a hobby for them, and not a business. They work very hard on the software for this device because they enjoy it, not because they're trying to meet a deadline.
